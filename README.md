The main objective is to create a predictive model, which gives us an optimal result, in deciding and buying the best properties in the Chapinero neighborhood of Bogota with the lowest possible budget.

One of the inputs of information that we will use to develop the workshop and propose the model will be from the following network address https://www. propertyati.com.co.

Within the proposed solution, that is; In the predictive model, we must consider that the database or information input has missing data, so we will propose some strategy that will help us complement this missing information, additionally we must be careful in overestimating the data, so that this does not lead to lead to an economic loss that has consequences on the organizational structure of the company

The main objective is to construct a predictive model of asking prices. From Rosen’s landmark paper ”Hedonic Prices and Implicit Markets: Product Differentiation in Pure Competition” (1974), we know that a vector of its characteristics, C = (c1, c2, . . . , cn), describes a differentiated good.
In the case of a house, these characteristics may include structural attributes (e.g., number of bedrooms), neighborhood public services (e.g., local school quality), and local amenities (e.g., crime, air quality, etc). Thus, we can write the market price of the house as:

Pi = f(ci1,ci2,...,cin)

# Some general reminders: 

It is essential how you write up the document. Be sure to be organized and consistent in explaining your equations and findings. Make sure that there are no compilation errors.

Write understandable code, separating and commenting on each section. Coding, like in writing, style is critical for readability. If the code is well written, it should be self-contained. There is no need to write everything you did. I encourage you to follow the tidyverse style guide
