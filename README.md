The main objective is to create a predictive model, which gives us an optimal result, in deciding and buying the best properties in the Chapinero neighborhood of Bogota  - Colombia with the lowest possible budget.

One of the inputs of information that we will use to develop the workshop and propose the models will be from the following address: https://www.propertyati.com.co. 2018 Colombian census data can be found at https://geoportal.dane.gov.co/servicios/descarga-y-metadatos/descarga-mgn-marco-geoestadistico-nacional/ and http://microdatos.dane.gov.co/index.php/catalog/643/get_microdata.

-  The code used can be found in the file "PS3.R".
-  Views contains graphs and tables that were used for descriptive analysis.

Within the proposed solution, that is; In the predictive model, we must consider that the database or information input has missing data, so we will propose some strategy that will help us complement this missing information, additionally we must be careful in overestimating the data, so that this doesn´t lead to lead to an economic loss that has consequences on the organizational structure of the company

The main objective is to construct a predictive model of asking prices. From Rosen’s landmark paper ”Hedonic Prices and Implicit Markets: Product Differentiation in Pure Competition” (1974), we know that a vector of its characteristics, C = (c1, c2, . . . , cn), describes a differentiated good.
In the case of a house, these characteristics may include structural attributes (e.g., number of bedrooms), neighborhood public services (e.g., local school quality), and local amenities (e.g., crime, air quality, etc). Thus, we can write the market price of the house as:

Pi = f(ci1,ci2,...,cin)


# Some general reminders: 

-  The execution speed will depend on the specific characteristics of the computer you are using, so you might need to wait a couple minutes or even hours while it processes.
